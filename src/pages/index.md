      Cross-discipline designer with a keen focus on understanding the humans I
      am designing for and how the designs I make can improve their lived in
      experience.  My iterative design approach emphasizes problem solving the
      pain points a user feels to create thoughtful user experiences.

        content: >-
          I incorporate Human-centered design principles into all of the
          experiences I create. I am an advocate for the users and ensure that
          key design decisions align with stakeholder goals.

      - title: Visual Design
        content: >-
          Through my experience executing compelling visual designs I have
          developed a strong understanding of UI mobile patterns and incorporate
          that knowledge when building intuitive interfaces.
      - title: UX Research
        content: >
          I am a firm believer that design decisions need to be backed by
          research and that assumptions must be validated. I conduct thorough
          User Research by utilizing user interviews, card sorting, affinity
          mapping, thematic analysis, quantitative analysis and creating user
          research reports.
      - title: Interaction Design
        content: >-
          My focus is to improve the user's interaction with each design.  My
          industry experience ranges from designing microinteractions to
          concepting Augmented Reality experiences that transform the way we
          interact with our physical world.
