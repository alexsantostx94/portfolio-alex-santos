## Introduction
The United States Air Force has expressed plans to increase diversity of future recruits and specifically for Pilot positions. They have asked for concepts on to improve the search feature design of the Air Force website.

## Challenge

Conceptualize and design a microinteraction prototype that improves the digital experience for a hopeful Air Force recruit. Ensure that this design remains accessible.


## User Audience

The user audience is primarily hopeful recruits who are trying to learn more about the Air Force and the enlistment process. Consider user audience that may reside in rural areas with slow internet connection speeds.

## Design Process

#### Storyboards

>I started out my ideation process with storyboards. The first storyboard is a frustrating experience of the current search feature. The second storyboard is an experience of my conecpt for an improved search experience.

#### Wireframes

>I wanted the user's flow to be very simple and limit the choices given when they first open the app. A study from [Netflix](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2843948) showed that a 80% of views come from their recommended algorithm. I wanted to apply that same concept for this app and greet the user with a simple choice based on how they are feeling, Thrill or Chill, and give them the option to scroll down for a Recommended list. 



## Solution

I designed a product that stays true to Smithâ€™s brand. A fully-fledged video service available on multiple platforms. A product with a minimal interface that allows users to discover thrilling videos like downhill skiing or something to wind down like slow tv.

##  Final Prototype

## Take Away
Designing a video streaming service on multiple platforms that allows users to immerse themselves in their favorite content was a project I really enjoyed. I especially enjoyed using an existing brand's identity and values to guide my creative process. Thank you for reading.
