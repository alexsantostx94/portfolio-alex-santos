## The Story
Requesting Emergency Services in a time of crisis should be a swift experience that leaves no opportunity for delay, as every second truly does count. I wanted to design a Conversational User Interface that effectively communicates to users on how to activate the 911 emergency response system. This concept design utilizes an AI chatbot to understand why the user is requesting emergency services and sends the appropriate emergency response resources to the scene of the emergency.

## Problems & Opportunites
#### Key Problem

Activating the current 911 system in the United States is an **antiquated** process that requires a caller to dial 3 numbers and press call. That requires the user to conduct 4 taps and wait for a 911 operator to pick up the phone. The caller is then asked “Do you need Police, Fire or EMS?” requiring the user to **think** on the spot of what resources they need. The operator then transfers the line to the caller’s selected need and the user has to wait until their call is picked up and every **second** that the user is waiting could be optimized to have emergency crews dispatched to the scene faster.

#### Competitive Analysis
##### America's 911 System
“Pandemic pushing America’s 911 system to breaking point”
“The strain could result in longer wait times and some providers going out of business, ambulance operators said. Ambulance providers are struggling to meet surging demand even while grappling with increased costs of personal protective equipment, overtime, staff shortages as workers fall ill and decreases in the type of emergency calls that are reimbursed.” 

How can we alleviate the strain that this pandemic has put on our 911 system?


##### Denmark's 911 System
“We put more staff on but we couldn’t keep up with the volume. Our biggest worry was that people with other diseases weren’t able to get through.”

“It worked well enough that the chatbot service was rolled out beyond just the initial Copenhagen area to all of Denmark.”
Denmark has proven that investing in a chatbot system can make for a more efficient Emergency response system.

## Research & Discovery
According to [The Nielsen Total Audience Report](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-hub/), in the second quarter of 2020 streaming video consumption grew, accounting for 25% of total television viewing minutes, up from 19% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Currently in the TV streaming app market, there are very few brands similar to Smith that have launched streaming services. The most notable brand with a similar style that has launched a streaming service is Red Bull. Red Bull’s TV platform is geared more towards adventure. With sports television apps making up [24%](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-hub/) of views, there is a viable market for an Outdoor Sports app that appeals to the user's itching to get back outside while we are still in the midst of a global pandemic.

## Solution

I designed a product that stays true to Smith’s brand. A fully-fledged video service available on multiple platforms. A product with a minimal interface that allows users to discover thrilling videos like downhill skiing or something to wind down like slow tv.
## Users & Audience
![Empathy Map & User Persona](/images/green-zebra.png)

>I wanted my user's persona to embody someone that is tired of Netflix and wants to feel like he is on the slopes or in the backcountry. He enjoys watching sports documentaries and wants to follow his favorite athletes.


## Design & Prototype


#### Task Flow
![task flow](/images/cool-sunflower.png)

>I wanted the user's flow to be very simple and limit the choices given when they first open the app. A study from [Netflix](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2843948) showed that a 80% of views come from their recommended algorithm. I wanted to apply that same concept for this app and greet the user with a simple choice based on how they are feeling, Thrill or Chill, and give them the option to scroll down for a Recommended list. 


#### Low Fidelity Mockup

>I started with a mobile first design process and scaled that up to fit a TV based app.

#### Component Library

> I wanted to create a component based design system that is ready for scalability.

#### High Fidelity Mockup

>I used a toggle at the top of the screen to give the user the ability to quickly switch back and forth from the two main categories of the app, Thrill or Chill.

## Take Away
I really enjoyed designing this CUI chatbot experience! Designing for emerging technologies is without a doubt challenging, but I am glad I could apply my knowledge of user interface design, interaction design and ux writing.
