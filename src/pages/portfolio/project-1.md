###### Disclaimer! *This is a concept design. I was not commissioned by Smith Optics to create this*.


# Introduction
Smith Optics has over 50 years of innovation and authenticity in optical wear. Smith produces and sells eyewear from ski goggles to sunglasses. They also make helmets that exceed current safety standards. Smith sponsors athletes in snow sports, fishing, surfing and cycling.

## Challenge

Smith has decided to create a streaming video service to share their content with the world. They have asked for visual designs for a remote-control-based TV app, and a smartphone app.

## Research
According to [The Nielsen Total Audience Report](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-hub/), in the second quarter of 2020 streaming video consumption grew, accounting for 25% of total television viewing minutes, up from 19% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Currently in the TV streaming app market, there are very few brands similar to Smith that have launched streaming services. The most notable brand with a similar style that has launched a streaming service is Red Bull. Red Bull’s TV platform is geared more towards adventure. With sports television apps making up [24%](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-hub/) of views, there is a viable market for an Outdoor Sports app that appeals to the user's itching to get back outside while we are still in the midst of a global pandemic.

## Solution

I designed a product that stays true to Smith’s brand. A fully-fledged video service available on multiple platforms. A product with a minimal interface that allows users to discover thrilling videos like downhill skiing or something to wind down like slow tv.
## Users & Audience
![Empathy Map & User Persona](/images/user-persona-empath.png)
>I wanted my user's persona to embody someone that is tired of Netflix and wants to feel like he is on the slopes or in the backcountry. He enjoys watching sports documentaries and wants to follow his favorite athletes.


## Design Process

### Ideation & Sketches
![sketches](/images/sketches-ideation.png)

>I started out my ideation with crazy 8's and a few initial directions. I settled on my first direction and continued my design process.

### Task Flow
![task flow](/images/Frame-12.png)
>I wanted the user's flow to be very simple and limit the choices given when they first open the app. A study from [Netflix](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2843948) showed that a 80% of views come from their recommended algorithm. I wanted to apply that same concept for this app and greet the user with a simple choice based on how they are feeling, Thrill or Chill, and give them the option to scroll down for a Recommended list. 


### Low Fidelity Mockup

>I started with a mobile first design process and scaled that up to fit a TV based app.

### Component Library

> I wanted to create a component based design system that is ready for scalability.

### High Fidelity Mockup

>I used a toggle at the top of the screen to give the user the ability to quickly switch back and forth from the two main categories of the app, Thrill or Chill.

## Take Away
Designing a video streaming service on multiple platforms that allows users to immerse themselves in their favorite content was a project I really enjoyed. I especially enjoyed using an existing brand's identity and values to guide my creative process. Thank you for reading.
