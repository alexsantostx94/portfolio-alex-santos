## The Story
Requesting Emergency Services in a time of crisis should be a swift experience that leaves no opportunity for delay, as every second truly does count. I wanted to design a Conversational User Interface that effectively communicates to users on how to activate the 911 emergency response system. This concept design utilizes an AI chatbot to understand why the user is requesting emergency services and sends the appropriate emergency response resources to the scene of the emergency.

## Problems & Opportunites
#### Key Problem

Activating the current 911 system in the United States is an **antiquated** process that requires a caller to dial 3 numbers and press call. That requires the user to conduct 4 taps and wait for a 911 operator to pick up the phone. The caller is then asked “Do you need Police, Fire or EMS?” requiring the user to **think** on the spot of what resources they need. The operator then transfers the line to the caller’s selected need and the user has to wait until their call is picked up and every **second** that the user is waiting could be optimized to have emergency crews dispatched to the scene faster.

#### Competitive Analysis
##### America's 911 System [Article](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/pandemic-pushing-americas-911-system-to-breaking-point-ambulance-operators-say/)
“Pandemic pushing America’s 911 system to breaking point”
“The strain could result in longer wait times and some providers going out of business, ambulance operators said. Ambulance providers are struggling to meet surging demand even while grappling with increased costs of personal protective equipment, overtime, staff shortages as workers fall ill and decreases in the type of emergency calls that are reimbursed.” 

How can we alleviate the strain that this pandemic has put on our 911 system?


##### Denmark's 911 System [Article](https://sifted.eu/articles/coronafiles-chatbots-helplines/)
“We put more staff on but we couldn’t keep up with the volume. Our biggest worry was that people with other diseases weren’t able to get through.”

“It worked well enough that the chatbot service was rolled out beyond just the initial Copenhagen area to all of Denmark.”
Denmark has proven that investing in a chatbot system can make for a more efficient Emergency response system.

|Being able to know that the 911 system will dispatch emergency response units to the scene of an emergency with accuracy and speed. | Reassurance that help will arrive to the scene and that the caller will be at ease when activating the 911 system. | Taking comfort in knowing that this emergency chatbot is well versed in emergency protocols and can provide guidance to the user when they need it the most.




## Design & Prototype


#### Conversational Flows

>I wanted the user's flow to be very simple and limit the choices given when they first open the app.

## Take Away
I really enjoyed designing this CUI chatbot experience! Designing for emerging technologies is without a doubt challenging, but I am glad I could apply my knowledge of user interface design, interaction design and ux writing.
